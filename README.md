# Flight Booking System

This project is a flight booking system that allows users to search and book flight reservations online. It was created as part of a semester assignment on database systems, which required the creation and maintenance of several SQL relations. I took this opportunity to learn about backend development using Flask with Python and built this project on top of the assignment with the help of a frontend team member.

## Features
